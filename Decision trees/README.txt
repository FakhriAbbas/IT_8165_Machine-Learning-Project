This project consists of analysis of two data sets. Digital Recognition Dataset and Amazon Baby Product Review dataset.

The algorithms implemented in Python using the following libraries:
1) sklearn using DecisionTreeClassifier class. The class uses ID3 classification in default.
2) pandas
3) numpy

File Description:
AmazonReviewEDA: Prepare the amazon data set for processing
AmazonReviewClassifier: Evaluate different Decision Tree Classifier.It also output results in csv style for plots later on.
DT_DigitalRecognition: Provide some statistics about the number of attribute and rows
DTModelDR: Evaluation different Decision Tree Classifier on various input. It also output results in csv style for plots later on.

There is no extra languages libraries used beyond the regular Python packages founded under Anaconda 4.2 distribution and Python 3.5.
