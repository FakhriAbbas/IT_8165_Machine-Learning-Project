This project consists of analysis of two data sets. Digital Recognition Dataset and Amazon Baby Product Review dataset.

The algorithms implemented in Python using the following libraries:
1) sklearn using KNeighborsClassifier class. 
2) pandas
3) numpy
4) StandardScaler

File Description:
amazon_review_knn.ipynb: Implements the KNN model used for the amazon dataset
Amazon-KNN-Results: results for all different runs for the amazon dataset
digital_recognition_knn.ipynb: Implements the KNN model used for the optical recognition dataset
OCR-KNN-Results: results for all different runs for the OCR dataset.

There is no extra languages libraries used beyond the regular Python packages founded under Anaconda 4.2 distribution and Python 3.5.
